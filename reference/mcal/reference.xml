    MCAL stands for Modular Calendar Access Library.</para>

   <para>
    Libmcal is a C library for accessing calendars. It's written to be
    very modular, with plugable drivers. MCAL is the calendar
    equivalent of the IMAP module for mailboxes.</para>

   <para>
    With mcal support, a calendar stream can be opened much like the
    mailbox stream with the IMAP support. Calendars can be local file
    stores, remote ICAP servers, or other formats that are supported
    by the mcal library.</para>

   <para>
    Calendar events can be pulled up, queried, and stored. There is
    also support for calendar triggers (alarms) and reoccuring events.</para>

   <para>
    With libmcal, central calendar servers can be accessed and used,
    removing the need for any specific database or local file
    programming.</para>

   <para>
    To get these functions to work, you have to compile PHP with
    <option role="configure">--with-mcal</option>. That requires the
    mcal library to be installed. Grab the latest version from <ulink url="&url.mcal;">&url.mcal;</ulink> and
    compile and install it.</para>

   <para>
    The following constants are defined when using the MCAL module:

    MCAL_SUNDAY,
    MCAL_MONDAY,
    MCAL_TUESDAY,
    MCAL_WEDNESDAY,
    MCAL_THURSDAY,
    MCAL_FRIDAY,
    MCAL_SATURDAY,

    MCAL_RECUR_NONE,
    MCAL_RECUR_DAILY,
    MCAL_RECUR_WEEKLY,
    MCAL_RECUR_MONTHLY_MDAY,
    MCAL_RECUR_MONTHLY_WDAY,
    MCAL_RECUR_YEARLY,

    MCAL_JANUARY,
    MCAL_FEBRUARY,
    MCAL_MARCH,
    MCAL_APRIL,
    MCAL_MAY,
    MCAL_JUNE,
    MCAL_JULY,
    MCAL_AUGUGT,
    MCAL_SEPTEMBER,
    MCAL_OCTOBER,
    MCAL_NOVEMBER, and
    MCAL_DECEMBER.

    Most of the functions use an internal event structure that is
    unique for each stream.  This alleviates the need to pass around
    large objects between functions. There are convenience functions
    for setting, initializing, and retrieving the event structure
    values.</para>
